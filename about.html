              <p>
                Formed in late 2002, Seattle's Rishloo continue to gain wide-spread recognition for their dynamic sound,
                thought-provoking lyrics and intense live performance. Often compared to bands like Dredg, The Mars
                Volta,
                Tool, and Fair to Midland, Rishloo strives to push the envelope of psychedelic, progressive art-rock,
                drawing inspiration from classic artists like The Beatles, David Bowie, and Pink Floyd, while
                incorporating the modern experimentation and emotional depth of artists such as Tori Amos, Deftones,
                Radiohead, Porcupine Tree, and more. <br> <br>

                In February 2012 the band announced that Andrew, the vocalist, decided to leave the band, this being the
                unexpected end of Rishloo. The remaining members briefly formed the band The Ghost Apparatus, until late
                in 2013 when Andrew and the band rejoined forces. On October 10th 2013 the band announced that they had
                decided to move forward making music as Rishloo. <br> <br>

                Continuing as they have since their inception as an entirely independent venture, Rishloo have sold
                5,500+
                units of their debut album, Terras Fames (2004) and 9,500+ units of their sophomore effort, Eidolon
                (2007)
                while attracting tens of thousands of fans online from around the globe. Interest in the band continues
                to
                grow exponentially on sites such as Myspace, Facebook, YouTube, ReverbNation, and Last.FM. <br> <br>

                With a lot of hard work and much appreciated help from their fans, Rishloo continue to travel and
                perform
                whenever possible throughout the U.S. and parts of Canada. In the course of their adventures, they have
                been privileged to share the stage with artists like Karnivool, Papa Roach, Fair to Midland, Ashes
                Divide,
                Sevendust, Trapt, Strata, and Judas Priest. <br><br>

                The band's latest effort, Living as Ghosts with Buildings as Teeth, was released December 2014.</p>
              <br><br>

              <img src="img/band.jpg" alt="band members" class="img-fluid"><br>
              <p>Music should be an adventure without a destination and the only wrong course is backwards. Having
                recently released their third and proudest effort, Feathergun, the Seattle-grown Rishloo (est. 2003) are
                moving heavily and stirring interest from around the world. <br><br>

                Even with their latest addition, manager Shaun Roy, they continue to pay their dues in blood, sweat and
                extremely hard work as one of the most notable independent groups in the US. They've toured throughout
                the
                States and regions of Canada on many self-promoted tours and along the way, have been privileged to
                share
                stages with Karnivool, Papa Roach, Fair to Midland, Ashes Divide, Cold, Sevendust, Trapt, Strata and
                even
                Judas Priest to name a few. With their dynamic sound, provocative ideas and lyrics, energetic and visual
                live show, they've managed to move people far and wide. <br><br>

                Plans are to continue driving Feathergun into the masses and expand their tours outward while breaking
                into international markets such as Europe, Japan, and Australia with hopes to enlighten many in the
                process. <br> <br>
