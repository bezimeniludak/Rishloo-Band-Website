            <div class="accordion-body">I waited until the last half of my senior year of high school to join choir. I
              was incredibly insecure and didn't think I'd be any good. After Feathergun, I took lessons for a few
              months from an amazing vocal instructor in Seattle named Susan Carr. I hope to work with her again in the
              future when I have the time and money. <br>
              The thing most people don't know is that my dad took voice lessons from a guy named Maestro David
              Kyle and I grew up listening to the vocal exercises basically from birth. So I feel like The Maestro, and
              of course, my Dad (and Mom, and Brother who all sing too) deserve a lot of credit.

            <div class="accordion-body">For me it was when we finished the album vocally. It was such a twilight zone
              moment. After all that we went through we had an album that was very emotional and had/have no idea of how
              or if people would feel that. To be seen. It was an amazing process. It rings to true to enjoy the journey
              and not look to far ahead. I certainly do more so on this album more than the previous ones. <br>-Dave
              <br><br>
              In my opinion, I recall and enjoyed renting gear, learning to engineer and record the album on our own
              and not have it sound like poo. Incredibly satisfying and I can't wait to see how we develop these skills
              even more on the next. It equates to creative FREEDOM! <br>-Sean
              <br><br>
              It's a tough thing to pinpoint one specific time. There were so many pinnacle moments. The first day of
              tracking drums after Drew had come back and we had all 4 members in the same room recording, experimenting
              with crazy sounds and different new elements while tracking bass/guitars, hearing everything for the first
              time in a full mix. And today. The release, we can finally share!!! <br>-Jesse

              They have been across the spectrum for me...from classic rock (60's-70's) to pop crap to modern rock
              artists (like deftones, radiohead, karnivool) to electronic music. But lately I've been jumping back into
              a lot of scores and classical compositions. <br> -Sean

              I see you guys get compared to the band Tool like all the time, do you feel this is accurate? Did you

            <div class="accordion-body">Yes, we've got it a LOT, but it is what ever people are going to relate what
              they are familiar with. Obviously people who listen to our weird shit listen to other wierd
              non-traditional artists. Were they an inspiration, yes. Are they now or have they been for a while, no. I
              honestly can't relate to them personally and when people relate us, I have to acknowledge that it's
              usually meant as a compliment. <br>-Sean
              <br><br>
              We definitely do get this a lot. And it's a blessing and a curse. We are in the progressive rock/metal
              genre. A Genre that Tool has more or less helped to create. You'd be pretty hard pressed to find a band in
              this style that can't be compared in some way to Tool. We have always had a large amount of respect for
              the group and it has been a challenge to stray away from their "sound", but at some point we had to
              realize that we are our own entity and people will think what they think and we just needed to continue to
              write what we write. <br>-Jesse
